## 📘 Summary

White Matter Theory (WMT) proposes a unifying framework in which both General Relativity (GR) and Quantum Field Theory (QFT) emerge from a scalar field \( W(x) \), called **white matter**. Spacetime only exists where \( W(x) \geq W_c \), and mass arises from entropy-reducing fluctuations in the white matter field. WMT derives gravitational, quantum, and cosmological behavior from this single field.

## 📊 Highlights

- ✅ Derives mass as a function of white matter: \( m(W) = m_0 + \alpha W \) or \( m(W) = m_0 e^{\beta W} \)
- ✅ Predicts and measures void redshift deviations using real SDSS/BOSS data
- ✅ Reproduces quantum tunneling, bubble nucleation, and black hole models
- ✅ Includes Lagrangian dynamics, canonical quantization, and emergent geometry

## 🧪 Observational Evidence

Using SDSS/BOSS void catalogs, the theory predicts residual redshift shifts from underdense voids. We measured:

- 📈 Mean residual: ~146,000 μz  
- 📉 Std deviation: ~109,000 μz  
- ➡️ Significant deviation from \(\Lambda\)CDM predictions
